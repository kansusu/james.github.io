    <p>The Dense Paraphrasing project develops an approach to enrich the surface form of natural language texts, using
type-based semantic operations to textually expose the deeper meaning of the corpus that was used
to make the original embeddings in the language model. </p>
<p>Dense paraphrasing (DP) model is a linguistically-motivated textual enrichment strategy that explicitly realizes the otherwise elided
compositional operations inherent in the meaning of the language. This involves broadly three
kinds of interpretive processes: (i) recognizing the diverse variability in linguistic forms that can be
associated with the same underlying semantic representation (paraphrases); (ii) identifying semantic
factors or variables that accompany or are presupposed by the lexical semantics of the words present
in the text, through dropped, hidden or shadow arguments; and (iii) interpreting or computing the
dynamic changes that actions and events impose on objects in the text.</p>
