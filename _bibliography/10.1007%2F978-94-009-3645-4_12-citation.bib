abstract="While differences in starting points, grammatical formalisms, and control structures make it intrinsically difficult to compare alternative designs for natural language generation systems, there are nevertheless many points of correspondence among them. To organize these points, we introduce an abstract reference model for the generation process. We then identify five specific factors with respect to that model that certain designs incorporate to make them more efficient computationally.",
